Overview

This app was built using React.

It is a simple memory game where the player tried to click on all of the images without clicking on any image twice.  

The application should render images of different Simpsons characters to the screen. When an image is hovered over with the mouse, the image should rotate 360 degrees.  Each image should listen for click events.  Each 'correct' click should increment the user's score by +1 and a success message should be displayed in the navbar at the top of the scree. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. The application should track the user's high score and that should persist unless the browser is refreshed.   

Each time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

Here's a screenshot of what the application looks like:
